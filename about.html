	<div class="post-content">
		<p>I'm Xavier Decuyper, a 18-year old web developer and I love to create simple but useful web applications.</p>

		<p>All my projects have a simple, yet elegant, design. I’m not a good designer and I therefore keep things deadly simple. Simple, but functional!</p>

		<p>I believe that software should be open and freely distributable. Everyone should have the right to change it, adapt it and than redistribute it.</p>

		<p>To prevent myself from getting bored, I’m always searching for the next challenge.</p>
