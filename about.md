Hi. Nice to meet you! My name is Xavier, I'm an all-round geek and video creator.

I like to learn, take on challenges and share my knowledge with others. These passions led me to creating this blog, a YouTube channel and serveral online learning courses.

Iâ€™m very eager to learn and always looking for new challenges and ways in which I can improve my projects & skills. 

## Open source
Most of my projects, including [this website](https://github.com/Savjee/savjee.be), are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Savjee). Open source software has helped me build great things and peek into how others were built.

## The Simply Explained YouTube Channel
In 2016 I started [my own YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxrdFPXJMeHru_b4Q_vTPQ) with one goal: taking complicated topics and explaining them in a simple, straightforward way. So far my videos have been watched over 8 million times and over 130,000 people have subscribed to the channel.

I make explainer videos on a variety of topics such as blockchains, encryption, space, technology, programming, ... Each video is the result of a lot of research and boiling everything down into an easy format.
