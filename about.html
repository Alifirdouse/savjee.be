            Hi.<br>Nice to meet you!
        </h1>

                <div class='post-description'>
                        <p>I'm Xavier Decuyper, a 23-year old web developer and I love to create simple but useful web applications.</p>

                        <p>All my projects have a simple, yet elegant, design. I’m not a good designer and I therefore keep things deadly simple. Simple, but functional!</p>

                        <p>I believe that software should be open and freely distributable. Everyone should have the right to change it, adapt it and then redistribute it. That's why I publish all my projects to <a href='https://github.com/Savjee'>Github</a>. Even <a href='https://github.com/Savjee/savjee.be'>this website is open source</a>!</p>

                        <p>To prevent myself from getting bored, I’m always searching for the next challenge.</p>


                        <h1>Contact me</h1>
                        <p>Questions or suggestions? I'm on <a href='https://twitter.com/Savjee'>Twitter (@Savjee)</a> and <a href='https://github.com/Savjee'>Github (Savjee)</a>!</p>
